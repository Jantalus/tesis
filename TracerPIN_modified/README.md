TracerPIN
====================

TracerPIN an Intel PIN tool for generating execution traces of a running process.
Support is limited to platforms supported by Intel PIN and TracerPIN has only been tested under
X86 and X86_64.

Installation
------------

TracerPIN requires the [Intel PIN framework](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/tool/pin-a-binary-instrumentation-tool-downloads.html) to compile and run as well as a few packages.
This tool was developed with version *3.30, kit 98830*

One would need for x86 and x86_64 support:

```bash
sudo apt-get install --no-install-recommends wget make g++
sudo apt-get install --no-install-recommends libstdc++-4.9-dev libssl-dev
sudo dpkg --add-architecture i386
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install --no-install-recommends gcc-multilib g++-multilib
sudo apt-get install --no-install-recommends libstdc++-4.9-dev:i386 libssl-dev:i386
```
---

As well as installing the cli tool `dwgrep` from the [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/pmachata/dwgrep) and the installation steps in their [website](https://pmachata.github.io/dwgrep/#installation).

To check if `dwgrep` is installed correctly try running the next command:
```bash
dwgrep $(whereis ls) -e 'entry'
```
you should get an output like the following:
```bash
...
[2e9d7]	subprogram
	external	true
	name	"rpl_realloc"
	decl_file	"lib/stdlib.h"
	decl_line	2067
	decl_column	1
	prototyped	true
	type	[2e95c] pointer_type
[2e9e4]	formal_parameter
	name	"ptr"
	decl_file	"lib/stdlib.h"
	decl_line	2067
	decl_column	20
	type	[2e95c] pointer_type
[2e9f1]	formal_parameter
	name	"size"
	decl_file	"lib/stdlib.h"
	decl_line	2067
	decl_column	32
	type	[2e90a] typedef
...
```

If the execution fails you may need to install the next dependencies:
```
libdw-dev 
libelf-dev 
liblzma-dev
libzstd-dev
bison
```

you also may need to update **`LD_LIBRARY_PATH`** to include the path to *libzwerg* (dependency of `dwgrep`). Usually on *`/usr/local/lib64`*


---

Then for Intel PIN, make sure the user has r/w access to the PIN installation and to ease the next steps define PIN_ROOT:

```bash
wget https://software.intel.com/sites/landingpage/pintool/downloads/pin-3.30-98830-g1d7b601b3-gcc-linux.tar.gz
tar xzf pin-3.30-98830-g1d7b601b3-gcc-linux.tar.gz
mv pin-3.30-98830-g1d7b601b3-gcc-linux /opt
export PIN_ROOT=/opt/pin-3.30-98830-g1d7b601b3-gcc-linux
echo -e "\nexport PIN_ROOT=/opt/pin-3.30-98830-g1d7b601b3-gcc-linux" >> ~/.bashrc
```

Now you're ready to compile TracerPIN and install it.

```bash
make
sudo make install
```

Usage
-----

Calling the tool without argument will provide some help:

```bash
Tracer
```

### Trace format

Here's the basic command line you would use to trace the `ls` program and generate a human readable trace 
file called `ls.log`.

```bash
Tracer -o ls.log -- ls
```

or to accept the default filename, just do

```bash
Tracer ls
```

The text format is relatively easy to read. Each line start with a tag indicating the information 
type:

* `[W]` Memory write operation
* `[R]` Memory read operation
* `[B]` Basic block, if `-b 1`
* `[C]` Function call, if `-c 1` or `-C 1`
* `[I]` Instruction execution, if `-i 1`
* With the debug flag `-d 1`
    * `[*]` Arguments
    * `[-]` Information on base image and libraries
    * `[!]` Information on filtered elements
    * `[T]` Thread event


#### Important Notes

> For optimization purposes the tool doesn't respect order for logs other than memory write and read logs, as they are buffered.
Meaning that if you include either `c/b/i/d` options you'll get either mixed traces or the traces generated by the previous options and the memory R/W's at the end. 

### Options

More details about options are listed when running `Tracer` command in the *CLI*, but here's a summarized list of options and their use *(in order of importance)*:


| Option | Description | Default value |
| ------ | ----------- | ------------- |
| `-o <path_to_file>` | Define where the log is saved | *trace-full-info.txt* |
| `-vname <var_name>` | Name of variable to be traced. Use with `-fname` | "" |
| `-fname <func_name>` | Name of function to search for `<var_name>`. Use with `-vname` | "" |
| `-vs n` | Size of variable in bytes. To trace **static** variables | 0 |
| `-td 0/1` | Discriminate on memory logs. (`[Owner][Accessing]`) | 0 |
| `-i 0/1` | Log all instructions | 0 |
| `-m 0/1` | Log all memory access | 1 |
| `-recursive 0/1` | Recursively trace malloced memory.  i.e. tracing a dynamic var that gets written other pointers to the heap (a `**int`) . Only used with `-fname -vname` | 1 |
| `-b 0/1` | Log all basic blocks [(*)](https://software.intel.com/sites/landingpage/pintool/docs/98484/Pin/html/index.html) | 0 |
| `-c 0/1` | Log all calls | 0 |
| `-C 0/1` | Log all calls with their first thre args | 0 |
| `-f 0/1/2` | (0) no filter (1) filter system libraries (2) filter all but main exec | 1 |
| `-F 0/(0x12..:0x588..)` | Use addresses as start:stop live filter | 0 |
| `-n 0/n` | Filter *n* occurrences, only with `-F` | 0 |
| `-q 0/1` | Be quiet under normal conditions | 0 |
| `-excl 0/1` | Exclude instrumentation outside main image | 1 |
| `-d 0/1` | Turn on debug logs. You can add your own with the function `DebugLog`, see examples in the code | 0 |
| `-f 0/1` | Enable file output | 1 |

### About static variables
*DWARF* debug data doesn't provide information about static variables and their size. For example a fixed array of `int`. That's why when trying to trace an static array you need to indicate the size of the variable with the `-vs` option, and reading from the code. This can be a problem if the static variable space is instantiated with a dynamic size: `int myArray[variable]`

If the variable is simply a primitive type, you can check the byte size with the next command:

```
dwgrep <your_executable> -e '(
|D|
let F := D entry ?DW_TAG_subprogram (@DW_AT_name == <your_func_name>); 
let V := F child ?TAG_variable (@DW_AT_name == <your_var_name>); 

V @DW_AT_type @DW_AT_byte_size
)'
```

### Filtering information

```
If no option is provided only memory accesses are logged: [R]/[W]
```

If you trace a large binary you might notice the trace size increase very fast and you might want 
to only trace specific address ranges or binaries. TracerPIN accepts several command line options
to filter the address range.

Option `-f` is used to limit tracing to a given range.

By default (`-f 1`) it's tracing all but system libraries.
It's possible to force to trace them too: `-f 0` or to trace only the main executable: `-f 2` or to
provide a range of addresses to trace: `-f 0x400000-0x410000`.
Option `-f` is about what to instrument when BBLs are getting parsed but it's also possible to give
indications when to instrument, e.g. when you want to capture only a specific iteration of a loop.
To do so, use option `-F 0x400000:0x410000`. This time the addresses serve as a start and stop indicators,
not as an address range, and it's possible to target a specific iteration with the option `-n`,
while by default all iterations will be recorded.

Examples for tracing variables
------------------------------
In this section we'll display several examples focusing on the trace of a specific variable in a function, be it static or dynamic.

### Static Variables

#### Primitive type

```cpp
int myFunction(int a) {
  int myVar = 10;
  myVar = a + 2;

  return myVar;
}
```
You would trace the variable `myVar` with:

```bash
Tracer -fname myFunction -vname myVar -vs 4 -o my_log_file.log -- executable
```

and with `a=2` we would get:

```smalltalk
[W]0x00007fffffffe00c 0x0000000a
[W]0x00007fffffffe00c 0x00000004
[R]0x00007fffffffe00c 0x00000004
```

#### Array of primitive type

```cpp
void myFunction() {
  int myTenPositionVector[10];

  for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    myTenPositionVector[i] = i;
  }
}
```
You would run (considering `int` occupies 4 bytes):
```
Tracer -fname myFunction -vname myTenPositionVector -vs 40 -o my_log_file.log -- executable
```

and get:
```smalltalk
[W]0x00007fffffffdfe0 0x00000000
[W]0x00007fffffffdfe4 0x00000001
[W]0x00007fffffffdfe8 0x00000002
[W]0x00007fffffffdfec 0x00000003
[W]0x00007fffffffdff0 0x00000004
[W]0x00007fffffffdff4 0x00000005
[W]0x00007fffffffdff8 0x00000006
[W]0x00007fffffffdffc 0x00000007
[W]0x00007fffffffe000 0x00000008
[W]0x00007fffffffe004 0x00000009
```

#### Other cases
If you know the byte size of another variable that isn't a primitive type (or pointer to) but the size is fixed, you could indicate the size with the `-vs` parameter. 

### Dynamic Variables
> In this cases we just need the `-fname` and `-vname`.

Here we have more potential cases, because we trace the memory requested by the executable with `malloc`.

#### Important note !!

There's a particular case you ought to look out for:
when reaching the function where you write to the variable you indicated by `-vname`, then the region of memory will **always be traced** regardless of where it is being written.
So if your program passes the pointer to the memory to different functions and threads the best option is to indicate by parameter the function that originally caledd `malloc`. 

To better understand, for example suppose you do something like this:
```cpp
void indirection(int* pointer, int size) {
	int* copy = pointer;
	// write to copy
}

void indirection2(int* pointer, int size) {
	int* copy = pointer;
	// write to copy
}

int main() {
	int* var = malloc(...); // Point 1
	var[i] = ...;
	indirection(var, ...); // Point 2
	indirection2(var, ...); // Point 3
}
```

If indicate to the tool to trace `-fname main -vname var` you would get all the writes and reads (from *Point 1* and onwards / or until freed).

`-fname indirection -vname copy` you would get the the write and reads from *Point 2* and onwards / or until freed.

`-fname indirection2 -vname copy` you would get the the write and reads from *Point 3* and onwards / or until freed.

This is because the instrumentation logic is modeled to start tracing from the function that asked for the memory (in this case **main**).


#### Malloc and write

```cpp
void instantiateAndWriteSomeArr() {
  int totalSize = 5;
  int *otherArr = (int *)malloc(totalSize * sizeof(int));

  for (int i = 0; i < totalSize; i++) {
    otherArr[i] = i + 1;
  }

  free(otherArr);
}
```

```
Tracer -fname instantiateAndWriteSomeArr -vname otherArr -o my_log_file.log -- executable
```

```smalltalk
[W]0x00007fffffffe008 0x000055555556d5e0
[W]0x000055555556d5e0 0x00000001
[W]0x000055555556d5e4 0x00000002
[W]0x000055555556d5e8 0x00000003
[W]0x000055555556d5ec 0x00000004
[W]0x000055555556d5f0 0x00000005
```

Notice here that we get also get the pointer returned by `malloc`

#### Write to the pointer of memory outside of the function

```cpp
void indirection(int* myArrPointer, int size) {
  for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
    myArrPointer[i] = i;
  }
}

int main() {
  int totalSize = 5;
  int *arr = (int *)malloc(totalSize * sizeof(int));

  for (int i = 0; i < totalSize; i++) {
    arr[i] = i * 10;
  }

  indireccion(arr, totalSize);
}
```
the memory region will be traced wherever is written. Here we'll trace the writes inside `main` and the ones in the `indirection` function.

```
Tracer -fname main -vname arr -o my_log_file.log -- executable
```

```smalltalk
[W]0x00007fffffffe070 0x000055555556d320
[W]0x000055555556d320 0x00000000
[W]0x000055555556d324 0x0000000a
[W]0x000055555556d328 0x00000014
[W]0x000055555556d32c 0x0000001e
[W]0x000055555556d330 0x00000028
[W]0x000055555556d320 0x00000000
[W]0x000055555556d324 0x00000001
[W]0x000055555556d328 0x00000002
[W]0x000055555556d32c 0x00000003
[W]0x000055555556d330 0x00000004
```
#### Write outside of function and other thread

In this case the option `-td 1` would come handy to distinguish which thread is writing the memory region.

```cpp
void indirection(int* myArrPointer, int size) {
  for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
    myArrPointer[i] = i*2;
  }
}

int main() {
  int totalSize = 5;
  int *arr = (int *)malloc(totalSize * sizeof(int));

  for (int i = 0; i < totalSize; i++) {
    arr[i] = i * 10;
  }

  std::thread t(indirection, arr, totalSize);
  t.join();
  ...
}
```
this would trace the writes in `main` and the ones by thread `t`:

```
Tracer -td 1 -fname main -vname arr -o my_log_file.log -- executable
```

```smalltalk
[W][0][0]0x00007fffffffe070 0x000055555556d320
[W][0][0]0x000055555556d320 0x00000000
[W][0][0]0x000055555556d324 0x0000000a
[W][0][0]0x000055555556d328 0x00000014
[W][0][0]0x000055555556d32c 0x0000001e
[W][0][0]0x000055555556d330 0x00000028
[W][1][0]0x000055555556d320 0x00000000
[W][1][0]0x000055555556d324 0x00000002
[W][1][0]0x000055555556d328 0x00000004
[W][1][0]0x000055555556d32c 0x00000006
[W][1][0]0x000055555556d330 0x00000008
```
Having `[OperatorThreadID][OwnerThreadID]` (`[1][0]`)

#### Write outside of the main image
This would be for example using the `std::strcpy` function:

```cpp
int main() {
  char* hello = (char *)malloc(20 * sizeof(char));
  std::strcpy(hello, "Hello");
}
```

```
Tracer -fname main -vname hello -o my_log_file.log -- executable
```


```smalltalk
[W]0x00007fffffffe080 0x000055555556d600
[W]0x000055555556d600 0x6c6c6548
[W]0x000055555556d604 0x006f
[R]0x000055555556d601 0x65
[W]0x000055555556d600 0x00414c42
```

Being: 
```
6c6c6548 = lleH
006f = \0o
```


Troubleshooting
---------------

We noticed the following problem using PIN on IA32 binaries on Debian Stretch under a Linux kernel > 4.3:

```
A: Source/pin/vm_ia32_l/jit_region_ia32_linux.cpp: XlateSysCall: 33: Sysenter is supported on IA32 only and the expected location is inside Linux Gate

################################################################################
## STACK TRACE
################################################################################
etc
```

Strangely enough, running a Debian Jessie in a Docker with the same kernel > 4.3 works fine.  
So till the root cause of this issue is found, please either make sure to run a kernel <= 4.3 or to run from a Docker image with Debian Jessie.
