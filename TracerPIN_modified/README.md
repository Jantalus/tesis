TracerPIN
====================

TracerPIN an Intel PIN tool for generating execution traces of a running process.
Support is limited to platforms supported by Intel PIN and TracerPIN has only been tested under
X86 and X86_64.

Installation
------------

TracerPIN requires the [Intel PIN framework](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/tool/pin-a-binary-instrumentation-tool-downloads.html) to compile and run as well as a few packages.
This tool was developed with version *3.30, kit 98830*

One would need for x86 and x86_64 support:

```bash
sudo apt-get install --no-install-recommends wget make g++
sudo apt-get install --no-install-recommends libstdc++-4.9-dev libssl-dev
sudo dpkg --add-architecture i386
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install --no-install-recommends gcc-multilib g++-multilib
sudo apt-get install --no-install-recommends libstdc++-4.9-dev:i386 libssl-dev:i386
```
---

As well as installing the cli tool `dwgrep` from the [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/pmachata/dwgrep) and the installation steps in their [website](https://pmachata.github.io/dwgrep/#installation).

To check if `dwgrep` is installed correctly try running the next command:
```bash
dwgrep $(whereis ls) -e 'entry'
```
you should get an output like the following:
```bash
...
[2e9d7]	subprogram
	external	true
	name	"rpl_realloc"
	decl_file	"lib/stdlib.h"
	decl_line	2067
	decl_column	1
	prototyped	true
	type	[2e95c] pointer_type
[2e9e4]	formal_parameter
	name	"ptr"
	decl_file	"lib/stdlib.h"
	decl_line	2067
	decl_column	20
	type	[2e95c] pointer_type
[2e9f1]	formal_parameter
	name	"size"
	decl_file	"lib/stdlib.h"
	decl_line	2067
	decl_column	32
	type	[2e90a] typedef
...
```

If the execution fails you may need to install the next dependencies:
```
libdw-dev 
libelf-dev 
liblzma-dev
libzstd-dev
bison
```

you also may need to update **`LD_LIBRARY_PATH`** to include the path to *libzwerg* (dependency of `dwgrep`). Usually on *`/usr/local/lib64`*


---

Then for Intel PIN, make sure the user has r/w access to the PIN installation and to ease the next steps define PIN_ROOT:

```bash
wget https://software.intel.com/sites/landingpage/pintool/downloads/pin-3.30-98830-g1d7b601b3-gcc-linux.tar.gz
tar xzf pin-3.30-98830-g1d7b601b3-gcc-linux.tar.gz
mv pin-3.30-98830-g1d7b601b3-gcc-linux /opt
export PIN_ROOT=/opt/pin-3.30-98830-g1d7b601b3-gcc-linux
echo -e "\nexport PIN_ROOT=/opt/pin-3.30-98830-g1d7b601b3-gcc-linux" >> ~/.bashrc
```

Now you're ready to compile TracerPIN and install it.

```bash
make
sudo make install
```

Usage
-----

Calling the tool without argument will provide some help:

```bash
Tracer
```

### Trace format

Here's the basic command line you would use to trace the `ls` program and generate a human readable trace 
file called `ls.log`.

```bash
Tracer -o ls.log -- ls
```

or to accept the default filename, just do

```bash
Tracer ls
```

The text format is relatively easy to read. Each line start with a tag indicating the information 
type:

* `[W]` Memory write operation
* `[R]` Memory read operation
* `[B]` Basic block, if `-b 1`
* `[C]` Function call, if `-c 1` or `-C 1`
* `[I]` Instruction execution, if `-i 1`
* With the debug flag `-d 1`
    * `[*]` Arguments
    * `[-]` Information on base image and libraries
    * `[!]` Information on filtered elements
    * `[T]` Thread event


#### Important Notes

> For optimization purposes the tool doesn't respect order for logs other than memory write and read logs, as they are buffered.
Meaning that if you include either `c/b/i/d` options you'll get either mixed traces or the traces generated by the previous options and the memory R/W's at the end. 

### Options

More details about options are listed when running `Tracer` command in the *CLI*, but here's a summarized list of options and their use *(in order of importance)*:


| Option | Description | Default value |
| ------ | ----------- | ------------- |
| `-o <path_to_file>` | Define where the log is saved | *trace-full-info.txt* |
| `-vname <var_name>` | [(*)](#aclaration) Name of variable to be traced. Use with `-fname` | "" |
| `-fname <func_name>` |[(*)](#aclaration) Name of function to search for `<var_name>`. Use with `-vname` | "" |
| `-vs n` | [(*)](#aclaration) Size of variable in bytes. To trace **static** variables | 0 |
| `-td 0/1` | Discriminate on memory logs. (`[Owner][Accessing]`) | 0 |
| `-i 0/1` | Log all instructions | 0 |
| `-m 0/1` | Log all memory access | 1 |
| `-recursive 0/1` | Recursively trace malloced memory.  i.e. tracing a dynamic var that gets written other pointers to the heap (a `**int`) . Only used with `-fname -vname` | 1 |
| `-b 0/1` | Log all basic blocks [(PIN BBL definition)](https://software.intel.com/sites/landingpage/pintool/docs/98484/Pin/html/index.html) | 0 |
| `-c 0/1` | Log all calls | 0 |
| `-C 0/1` | Log all calls with their first thre args | 0 |
| `-f 0/1/2` | (0) no filter (1) filter system libraries (2) filter all but main exec | 1 |
| `-F 0/(0x12..:0x588..)` | Use addresses as start:stop live filter | 0 |
| `-n 0/n` | Filter *n* occurrences, only with `-F` | 0 |
| `-q 0/1` | Be quiet under normal conditions | 0 |
| `-excl 0/1` | Exclude instrumentation outside main image | 1 |
| `-d 0/1` | Turn on debug logs. You can add your own with the function `DebugLog`, see examples in the code | 0 |
| `-f 0/1` | Enable file output | 1 |

<a id="aclaration"></a>
> (*): This options won't work if the executable doesn't have debug information

### Executable considerations
If you wish to trace a specific variable you must assure that the executable is compiled with the following parameters (for `clang++/g++`):

* `-g` to include debugging information
* `-g-dwarf-4` given that the tool reads based on this debug format, to format to *DWARF 4* standard
* `-fno-omit-frame-pointer` to keep the stack frame and maintain consistent behaviour 

### About static variables
Debug data doesn't provide information about static variables and their size. For example a fixed array of `int`. That's why when trying to trace an static array you need to indicate the size of the variable with the `-vs` option, and reading from the code. This can be a problem if the static variable space is instantiated with a dynamic size: `int myArray[variable]`

If the variable is simply a primitive type, you can check the byte size with the next command:

```
dwgrep <your_executable> -e '(
|D|
let F := D entry ?DW_TAG_subprogram (@DW_AT_name == <your_func_name>); 
let V := F child ?TAG_variable (@DW_AT_name == <your_var_name>); 

V @DW_AT_type @DW_AT_byte_size
)'
```

### Filtering information

```smalltalk
If no option is provided only memory accesses are logged: [R]/[W]
```

If you trace a large binary you might notice the trace size increase very fast and you might want 
to only trace specific address ranges or binaries. TracerPIN accepts several command line options
to filter the address range.

Option `-f` is used to limit tracing to a given range.

By default (`-f 1`) it's tracing all but system libraries.
It's possible to force to trace them too: `-f 0` or to trace only the main executable: `-f 2` or to
provide a range of addresses to trace: `-f 0x400000-0x410000`.
Option `-f` is about what to instrument when BBLs are getting parsed but it's also possible to give
indications when to instrument, e.g. when you want to capture only a specific iteration of a loop.
To do so, use option `-F 0x400000:0x410000`. This time the addresses serve as a start and stop indicators,
not as an address range, and it's possible to target a specific iteration with the option `-n`,
while by default all iterations will be recorded.

Examples for tracing variables
------------------------------
In this section we'll display several examples focusing on the trace of a specific variable in a function, be it static or dynamic.

Refer to the [examples.cpp](examples.cpp) file to run the examples. All the snippets shown below show the code partially.

Compile the example
```bash
g++ -fno-omit-frame-pointer examples.cpp -gdwarf-4 -g -o compiled
```

### Static Variables

#### Global variable *(Ex 0)*

> We need the `-vname` and `-vs`

```cpp
int globalArray[4] = {0};

int main() {
  // Ex 0
  for(int i = 0; i < 4; i++)
    globalArray[i] = 15;
}
```

You would trace the variable `globalArray` with:

```bash
Tracer -vname myVar -vs 16 -o my_log_file.log -- compiled
```

```smalltalk
[W]0x0000555555558080 0x0000000f
[W]0x0000555555558084 0x0000000f
[W]0x0000555555558088 0x0000000f
[W]0x000055555555808c 0x0000000f
```

#### Primitive type *(Ex 1)*

> We need the `-fname`, `-vname` and `-vs`

```cpp
int primitiveType(int a) {
  int myVar = 10;
  myVar = a + 2;

  return myVar;
}
```

You would trace the variable `myVar` with:

```bash
Tracer -fname primitiveType -vname myVar -vs 4 -o my_log_file.log -- compiled
```

and with `a=2` we would get:

```smalltalk
[W]0x00007fffffffe00c 0x0000000a
[W]0x00007fffffffe00c 0x00000004
[R]0x00007fffffffe00c 0x00000004
```

#### Array of primitive type *(Ex 2)*

```cpp
void fixedArray() {
  int myTenPositionVector[10];

  for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    myTenPositionVector[i] = i;
  }

  int a = myTenPositionVector[3]; // [R] position 4 with value 3
}

int main() {
  fixedArray();
}
```
You would run (considering `int` occupies 4 bytes):
```bash
Tracer -fname fixedArray -vname myTenPositionVector -vs 40 -o my_log_file.log -- compiled
```

and get:
```smalltalk
[W]0x00007fffffffe000 0x00000000
[W]0x00007fffffffe004 0x00000001
[W]0x00007fffffffe008 0x00000002
[W]0x00007fffffffe00c 0x00000003
[W]0x00007fffffffe010 0x00000004
[W]0x00007fffffffe014 0x00000005
[W]0x00007fffffffe018 0x00000006
[W]0x00007fffffffe01c 0x00000007
[W]0x00007fffffffe020 0x00000008
[W]0x00007fffffffe024 0x00000009
[R]0x00007fffffffe00c 0x00000003 // read 4th position
```

#### Other cases
If you know the byte size of another variable that isn't a primitive type (or pointer to) but the size is fixed, you could indicate the size with the `-vs` parameter, i.e. a struct that lives on the satck.

### Dynamic Variables
> In this case we just need the `-fname` and `-vname`

Here we have more potential cases, because we trace the memory requested by the executable with `malloc`.

#### Important note !!

There's a particular case you ought to look out for:
when reaching the function, indicated with `-fname`, where you write to the variable you indicated by `-vname`, then the region of memory will **always be traced** regardless of where it is being written.
So if your program passes the pointer to the memory to different functions and threads the best option is to indicate by parameter the function that originally caledd `malloc`. 

To better understand, for example suppose you do something like this:
```cpp
void indirection(int* pointer, int size) {
	int* copy = pointer;
	// write to copy
}

void indirection2(int* pointer, int size) {
	int* copy = pointer;
	// write to copy
}

int main() {
	int* var = malloc(...); // Point 1
	var[i] = ...;
	indirection(var, ...); // Point 2
	indirection2(var, ...); // Point 3
}
```

If you indicate to the tool to trace 

* `-fname main -vname var` you would get all the writes and reads (from *Point 1* and onwards / or until freed).
* `-fname indirection -vname copy` you would get the the write and reads from *Point 2* and onwards / or until freed.
* `-fname indirection2 -vname copy` you would get the the write and reads from *Point 3* and onwards / or until freed.

This is because the instrumentation logic is modeled to start tracing from the function that asked for the memory (in this case **main**).


#### Malloc and write *(Ex 3 & 4)*

```cpp
void mallocAndWriteArray() {
  int totalSize = 5;
  int *otherArr = (int *)malloc(totalSize * sizeof(int));

  for (int i = 0; i < totalSize; i++) {
    otherArr[i] = i + 1;
  }

  int a = otherArr[3];

  free(otherArr);
}

int main() {
  mallocAndWriteArray();
  // Ex 4 within main
}
```

```bash
Tracer -fname mallocAndWriteArray -vname otherArr -o my_log_file.log -- compiled
```

```smalltalk
[W]0x00007fffffffe028 0x000055555556b320
[W]0x000055555556b320 0x00000001
[W]0x000055555556b324 0x00000002
[W]0x000055555556b328 0x00000003
[W]0x000055555556b32c 0x00000004
[W]0x000055555556b330 0x00000005
[R]0x000055555556b32c 0x00000004
```

Notice here that we get also get the pointer returned by `malloc`

#### Write to the pointer of memory outside of the function where it's declared *(Ex 5)*

```cpp
void indirection(int* myArr, int size) {
  for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
    myArr[i] = i;
  }
}

int main() {
  int otherTotalSize = 3;
  int *otherArr = (int *)malloc(otherTotalSize * sizeof(int));
  for (int i = 0; i < otherTotalSize; i++) {
    otherArr[i] = i;
  }
  indirection(otherArr, otherTotalSize);
  free(otherArr);
}
```
the memory region will be traced wherever is written. Here we'll trace the writes inside `main` and the ones in the `indirection` function.

```bash
Tracer -fname main -vname otherArr -o my_log_file.log -- compiled
```

```smalltalk
[W]0x00007fffffffe090 0x000055555556b320
[W]0x000055555556b320 0x00000000
[W]0x000055555556b324 0x00000001
[W]0x000055555556b328 0x00000002
[W]0x000055555556b320 0x00000000 // from indirection
[W]0x000055555556b324 0x00000001
[W]0x000055555556b328 0x00000002
```

#### Write outside of function and other thread *(Ex 6)*

In this case the option `-td 1` would come handy to distinguish which thread is writing the memory region.

```cpp
void indirection(int* myArrPointer, int size) {
  for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
    myArrPointer[i] = i;
  }
}

int main() {
  int anotherSize = 3;
  int *anotherArray = (int *)malloc(anotherSize * sizeof(int));
  indirection(anotherArray, anotherSize);
  std::thread t(indirection, anotherArray, anotherSize);

  t.join();

  free(anotherArray);
}
```
this would trace the writes in `main` and the ones by thread `t`:

```bash
Tracer -fname main -vname anotherArray -o my_log_file.log -td 1 -- compiled
```

```smalltalk
[W][0][0]0x00007fffffffe078 0x000055555556b320
[W][0][0]0x000055555556b320 0x00000000
[W][0][0]0x000055555556b324 0x00000001
[W][0][0]0x000055555556b328 0x00000002
[W][1][0]0x000055555556b320 0x00000000
[W][1][0]0x000055555556b324 0x00000001
[W][1][0]0x000055555556b328 0x00000002
```
Having `[OperatorThreadID][OwnerThreadID]` (`[0]` is main, `[1]` is **t**)

#### Write outside of the main image *(Ex 7)*
This would be for example using the `std::strcpy` function:

```cpp
int main() {
  char* hello = (char *)malloc(20 * sizeof(char));
  std::strcpy(hello, "Hello");

  char a = hello[1]; // [R]

  free(hello);
}
```

```bash
Tracer -fname main -vname hello -o my_log_file.log -- compiled
```

#### Array with mor dimensions (extendable to n) *(Ex 8)*

```cpp
int main() {
  int rows = 3, cols = 4;

  int** matrix = (int **)malloc(rows * sizeof(int *));

  for (int i = 0; i < rows; ++i){
    matrix[i] = (int *)malloc(cols * sizeof(int));
    // each write in matrix[i] will add the 
    // region of memory to the list of "regions of interest"
  }

  for (int i = 0; i < rows; ++i){
    matrix[i][0] = i; // Reads m[i] for each write --> [R] and [W]
  }

  for (int i = 0; i < rows; ++i){
    matrix[i][2] = i;
  }

  free(matrix);
}
```

```bash
Tracer -fname main -vname matrix -o my_log_file.log -- compiled
```
lets alias `matrix` to `m`

```smalltalk
[W]0x00007fffffffe0a0 0x000055555556b320 // write on m
[W]0x000055555556b320 0x000055555556b4b0 // m[0]
[W]0x000055555556b328 0x000055555556b4d0 // m[1]
[W]0x000055555556b330 0x000055555556b4f0 // m[2]
[R]0x000055555556b320 0x000055555556b4b0 // read m[0] to write col 0
[W]0x000055555556b4b0 0x00000000 // write m[0][0]
[R]0x000055555556b328 0x000055555556b4d0 // read m[1] to write col 0
[W]0x000055555556b4d0 0x00000001
[R]0x000055555556b330 0x000055555556b4f0
[W]0x000055555556b4f0 0x00000002
[R]0x000055555556b320 0x000055555556b4b0
[W]0x000055555556b4b8 0x00000000
[R]0x000055555556b328 0x000055555556b4d0
[W]0x000055555556b4d8 0x00000001
[R]0x000055555556b330 0x000055555556b4f0
[W]0x000055555556b4f8 0x00000002
```


Troubleshooting
---------------

We noticed the following problem using PIN on IA32 binaries on Debian Stretch under a Linux kernel > 4.3:

```
A: Source/pin/vm_ia32_l/jit_region_ia32_linux.cpp: XlateSysCall: 33: Sysenter is supported on IA32 only and the expected location is inside Linux Gate

################################################################################
## STACK TRACE
################################################################################
etc
```

Strangely enough, running a Debian Jessie in a Docker with the same kernel > 4.3 works fine.  
So till the root cause of this issue is found, please either make sure to run a kernel <= 4.3 or to run from a Docker image with Debian Jessie.
